## Details

### murm-subagent

Murmuration currently spawns separate CLI processes. This doesn't work inside an existing Claude Code session. Should use Task tool sub-agents instead for parallel features.

### agent-timeouts

Configurable timeout per stage (default: 5 min). Support `--timeout=10m` flag. Graceful termination with status recording.

### rollback

`murmur8 rollback <feature-slug>` to revert commits. Uses git history to find commits by feature. Supports `--dry-run`.

### agent-overrides

Per-project agent customization via `.blueprint/agents/overrides/AGENT_*.md`. Override content appended to base specs.

### resume-from-stage

More granular than queue-based resume. `--resume-from=nigel` to skip earlier stages. Validates artifacts exist first.

### docey-agent

Fifth agent to update README/CLAUDE.md after Codey implements. Identifies user-facing changes and updates docs automatically.

### mcp-repos-server

MCP server for cross-repository context in distributed architectures. See FEATURE_IDEAS.md for full specification.

### backlog-tooling

CLI commands: `npx murmur8 backlog`, `backlog add`, `backlog next`, `backlog murm P1`.
